//A function is a way to encapsulate code for later use.
//It can take arguments, which are used as variables inside
// the function. It usually returns a value, which can be 
// used later on or displayed immediately.

function variables {
// Variables on javascript are contailers for data values;
		var x = 5;
		var y = " Houses";
		var z = x + y;
}

function debugging {
// The search for eerors on your Javascript code a way an
// an simple way to debug on Javascript is to use the 
// console.log() method;
		
		var x = 5;
		var y = " Houses";
		var z = x + y;
		console.log(z);
//or setting the debugger keyword as a breaking point

		debugger;
		document.getElementbyId("cheetsheet").innerHTML = z;
}

function differentDatatypes {

//Javascript has different data types that can be stored or
//used for example:
	var x = 5;                                 // Number
	var y = " Houses";       	               // String
	var w = true;							   // Boolean
}

function arrays {
//JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
//Array items are separated by commas.
	var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
}

function testing{
//Any test returns a boolean true or false • To test if two 
//strings are equal:
"stringone" === "string two"; >false
//Using three equals signs instead of two also checks 
//the object type • If you don't check type, these are both 
//true:
}

function logic {
//The control ﬂow of your program • Think of logic as a river
//that branches off in a few differentways. 
//It allows you to make the computer do the thinking for you!
	var x = 5;
	var y = " Houses";
	var z = x + y;
	if (z != x + " Houses") z = x + " Houses";
}
